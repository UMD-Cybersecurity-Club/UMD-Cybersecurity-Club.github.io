<h1>History of Computer and Information Security with the development of Computing</h1>

<p>Research in Computer Security is older than most will think.
- Originated in the 70s. <br />

It also has Wi-Fi capability. That can connect to your iPad. To then upload your shot footage up to YouTube. It was attempted to be sold to the military and to domestic polic forces. 
This would provide an available record of shots that were taken by officer.  </p>

<p>Hackers were able to find holes in the system and exploit it. </p>

<p>Now when did anyone want to combine computers with firearms? As early of the 1930s. <br />
Originally people have to do many calculations by hand for determining the physics of the ballistics of the firearms. 
One example is the Mark 1 Fire Control Computer. It was a component of a control system used by the US Navy during World War II to help make precision targeting. It was a mechanical analog device. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_I_Fire_Control_Computer">wiki link</a>. </p>

<p>Delving more into the developments of computing during the Navy, around the advent of radar, there were issues with communicating tracking informaiton with all parts of the ship. Originally people had to run around a ship with papers regarding informaiton on the tracking, but moved to the implementation of mechanical analog computer systems. Many of the computing development was pushed by the Navy and funded by the Navy. </p>

<p>On the other end of the spectrum, there was alot of development in computing in the field of cryptanalysis. One big example is the Black Chamber, who was dealt with the task of decrypting Japanese diplomatic codes. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Chamber">Black Chamber wiki</a>. Spy stuff!</p>

<p>As the war progressed, we saw a shift of cryptanalysis moved from a linguistic-based focus towards more statistical-based model. As this move was made, we saw more pushes towards general purpose computing, and a notable example is the <a href="http://www.i-programmer.info/history/8-people/341-eckert-and-mauchley-and-eniac.html?start=1">ENIAC</a>.</p>

<p>Parallel to this development of ENIAC was that of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture">Von Neumann Architecture</a>.</p>

<p>With this kind of push towards this type of system, there arose the observation of a possible Denial of Service condition, where certain inputs will cause stalls within the system since the type of calculations they were doing could end up reaching a non-converging state, ie an effective halt. </p>

<p>From here we see the first convergence between computing and computer security. As technology developed, and general purpose computing became more prevalent, we saw more research into the time performance of programs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem">(Halting Problem)</a>, and as an extention of this there were other branches that came back to the Halting Problem, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem">Non-Intereference Security</a>.</p>

</ul>

<p>Many of these issues that we see here are a part of a field that looks at computer security from the low level interal systems. (ie, the system leaking information)</p>

<h1>History of Computer Hacking</h1>

<p>Mostly started around the advent of the internet, while the connections were mainly made between academic institutions. 
A big way to hack into the systems at the time was just to guess passwords. At the time, it made sense to just make one password and remember it. Now we have a multitude of more systems than we did then, and so the number of passwords we have is largely more. 
As computing moved from independent systems towards the internet, guessing passwords became harder as security measures were implemented, and much harder when C introduced firewalls. 
Many hackers were deterred, but some were able to see that the C based system itself had vulnerabilities, and then they smashed the stack, and they still do. 
So now as we make changes to our security policies, we have to think about how it changes how the attackers will approach our systems. </p>

<h1>The Pitch</h1>

To look for pathelogical vulnerabilities within algorithms that end up consuming a large amount of system resources. Java experience is desired, as it is focused on analyzing Java programs. </p>

<h1>Why is it good to have your name on a publication?</h1>

<p>Companies love it. It is a large resume booster. Remember that the resume will only be a conversation opener, the rest of the interview is up to you. But having that research experience will give you plenty to talk about. </p>

<p>It will also be a fun experience, and who doesn't enjoy fun?</p>
