<h3>Bash Scriping</h3>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/UMD-Cybersecurity-Club/GeneralBody/blob/master/Spring2016/Presentations/2016-02-11_BashHacking-AutomationandProblemSolving.pptx?raw=true">Presentation Link</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Bash scripting gives users the power of the commandline while allowing the automative capabilities of scripting. </li>
</ul>

<p>Say you have a script you want to run, in this example lets say its a simple counter that goes from 0 to some power of 2. I have one written in Python below. Lets call it <strong>prog.py</strong>.  </p>

<pre><code class="python">#!/usr/bin/env python

import math

t = int(raw_input())
x = 2**t

count = 0
while count &lt; x:
    count = count + 1

print count</code></pre>

<p>Here the program takes in <strong>stdin</strong> or Standard Input. This means when you run it, you will be prompted to enter something. </p>

<p>But before you run it, you must make is <em>executable</em> by giving it the correct permission. In bash each file has the permission to either <em>write</em>, <em>read</em>, or <em>execute</em>. To allow a progarm to be executable just do the command:</p>

<p><pre><code class="bash">$ chmod +x prog.py</code></pre>
This will allow the program to have permission to execute on your machine. Now to execute our <strong>prog.py</strong>. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Running the program, if you enter say 5, it will print 32 to the terminal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><pre><code class="bash">$ ./prog.py
5
32</code></pre>
Now say you wanted to run this program for a range of numbers from 5 to 25. You could modify this program to do this, also you can do it just as simply in bash scripting. </p>

<p>Here is a simple bash script which can accomplish this. Lets call it <strong>test.sh</strong>.</p>

<pre><code class="bash">#!/bin/bash

for i in $(seq 5 25); do
    ./prog.py &lt;&lt;&lt; $i
done</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>To execute a script you have wrote in bash, you need to make sure you end the name with <em>.sh</em> for <em>shell</em>, start your script with this header:</p>

  <pre><code class="bash">#!/bin/bash  </code></pre>
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
  <p>This lets the computer know that when you want to run this, it needs to interpret it as a bash script. </p>

<p>Earlier I started my Python script with a different header so that my computer knows to interpret it as a Python script. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Starting with the overall view of the script, we can see it a simple for loop. We see that the conditional is made with <strong>for i in $(seq 5 25)</strong>. "<strong>i</strong>" is the iterating variable, but what is <strong>seq</strong> and the dollar sign for? </p>

<p>In bash, variable data is accessed using the prefix <strong>$</strong>. Normally a variable initialization would look like this:
<pre><code class="bash">number=5
name="testudo"</code></pre></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Make sure when initailizing variables that you do not makes spaces in between the equals signs, the assignment, or the value being assigned. </p>

<p>In order to access the variables you just precede the name of the variables with a <strong>$</strong>. </p>

<p><pre><code class="bash">$number
$name</code></pre></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now that we know how variable assignment works, what is <strong>seq 5 25</strong>? <strong>seq</strong> is a command in bash that takes 2 parameters, a start and end number, and will give you every number in <em>sequence</em> from start to end. Run it on the command line and you will get a <em>sequence</em> from your staring number to ending number. </p>

<p><pre><code class="bash">$ seq 1 10
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10</code></pre>
We can take advantage of this in our for loop, since with each loop <strong>seq</strong> will iterate once and update the value of <strong>i</strong> each time. This is why we have it as <strong>$(seq 5 25)</strong> so we can just access the stored ouput from <strong>seq</strong> and assign it to <strong>i</strong>. </p>

<p>Going back to our script, we end the conditional for the for loop with a semicolon, and start the code block we want to have done in the loop with <strong>do</strong>, and when we are done we close it with <strong>done</strong>. Easy, right?</p>

<p><pre><code class="bash">for i in $(seq 5 25); do
    ./prog.py &lt;&lt;&lt; $i
done</code></pre>
In between our <strong>do</strong> and <strong>done</strong> we have the meat of our script. To summarize, we are executing the script while feeding it input with the values from variable <strong>i</strong>. </p>

<p>Our program <em>prog.py</em> is being executed, and the triple left angle brackets means that we want to direct some input into the program. This is the same as typing a number into the commandline after you executed the python script, only this time the value from <strong>i</strong> is being fed into the script. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Say the <strong>i</strong> = 5. The two below are fulfilling the same function. The first is the input redirection in the script, and the second is input from you typing into the command line. </p>

  <p><pre><code class="bash">./prog.py &lt;&lt;&lt; 5 </code></pre></p>

  <p><pre><code class="bash">$ ./prog.py
5  </code></pre></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you ran <strong>test.sh</strong> you should see this as a result. </p>

<p><pre><code class="bash">$ ./test.sh

You may have noticed the last few to take a little while to get printed. That is just because they are large numbers that need to be counted up to, but I wonder if you could time how long it took the program to count each of those numbers...</p>

<p>This is indeed possible, but I will leave this for you to attempt on your own. I will give you a hint:</p>

<p><pre><code class="bash">$ time ./test.sh</code></pre>
Additionally, in bash every command comes with its own set of <strong>man</strong> pages, or <em>manual</em> if you will. To see the <strong>man</strong> pages of any command, just do <strong>man</strong>, followed by the command you want to know about more. Also remember: <strong>Google is your friend.</strong></p>

<p><pre><code class="bash">$ man time</code></pre></p>
